# Text-Based-Game-Titan-
The purpose of this program is to play a text-based game in which you traverse rooms as well as add items to your inventory. The player uses cardinal directions in order to traverse the level. The game will continue to play until you run into the final boss the titan. At that point, the player will either defeat the titan if they have all items in their inventory, or the titan crushes them because they are unprepared.
